# friend-finder

This assignment utilizes the NPM "express" and Node.js to bring a "matching" app together that asks the user for their answers (on a 
scale from 1-5) to a set of ten questions that are meant to be personality questions.  Mind you, these questions are actually not 
personality questions, and they are just a manifestation of tomfoolery.  

The user will have supplied their name and a link to a picture on the internet, and based on the answers the user provides, there
will be a suggestion as to which of three pre-loaded "friends" their answers to the personality questions best match to.  There is a 
small algorithm written to do the matching (need to re-look at my code and explain further).  

The pre-loaded "friends" are stored within a local JS file, and are not saved in a database.
